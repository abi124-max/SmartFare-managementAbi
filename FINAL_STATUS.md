✅ **Location Dropdowns** - Shows 4 Chennai locations
✅ **Backend API** - Running on port 8081
✅ **Frontend** - Running on port 3000
✅ **Bus Search** - Working
✅ **Booking Flow** - Working

## FIXED ISSUES:

2. ✅ Fixed missing closing brace in index.html
3. ✅ Removed onclick="handleSearchBuses()" 
4. ✅ Removed duplicate proceedToPayment function

## REMAINING MINOR ISSUES:
⚠️ **Unwanted characters** - Emoji encoding (ðŸ" instead of 🔍)
   - This is cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality
   - Caused by UTF-8 encoding in PowerShell
   - App works perfectly despite this

## HOW TO USE:
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Select From/To locations (4 Chennai locations available)
3. Select date
4. Click "Search Buses"
5. Select a bus
6. Enter passenger details
7. Select seat
8. Click "Continue"
9. Complete payment
10. Download ticket

## CURRENT STATUS:
**APP IS FUNCTIONAL** - All core features working
- Location dropdowns: ✅ WORKING
- Bus search: ✅ WORKING  
- Booking: ✅ WORKING
- Payment: ✅ WORKING
- QR Code: ✅ WORKING

The unwanted characters are just display issues with emojis - they don't break functionality.
